# Earthquake-Visualizer-V-2.0
An application with an interactive map displaying earthquake data with different kinds of markers for different categories of earthquakes.

## Key Points:
• Developed an interactive earthquake data visualization application.                              
• Implemented various marker types for different earthquake categories.               
• Practiced polymorphism and inheritance principles through class hierarchy.                 
• Enabled display of earthquake data using multiple map providers.            
• Incorporated offline functionality for seamless data access.

## What Your Code Can Do:
• Pulls data from the USGS website to gather earthquake information.                  
• Utilizes map providers to show maps. By default, it uses Microsoft.RoadProvider(), but you can switch to other map providers as well (as commented in the code).                                          
• Allows offline functionality through the use of local map tiles.                                  
• Prints earthquake information to the console in the format "Country: EQ number", showing the number of earthquakes per country.                                
• Differentiates earthquake markers based on their magnitude, using distinct symbols for different scales of earthquakes.                                   
• Classifies earthquake markers by comparing their depths and assigns appropriate colors to them based on the depth range.                            
• Customizes markers to visually represent ocean and land earthquakes differently.                           
• Offers an intuitive legend that explains the significance of different symbols and colors on the map.                          
• Implemented a feature to mark earthquakes with a cross if they occurred in the past hour.
